      The chocolate cake is a classic dessert made with a rich and moist
      chocolate-flavored cake base. Typically, it involves combining ingredients
      such as all-purpose flour, sugar, cocoa powder, eggs, milk, and vegetable
      oil. The batter is then baked until the cake rises and sets. Once cooled,
      the cake is often frosted with a velvety chocolate frosting made from
      ingredients like butter, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla
      extract. The end result is a decadent and indulgent treat, perfect for
      various occasions and enjoyed by chocolate lovers worldwide.

    <strong>Recipe</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round
        cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking
        powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry
        ingredients. Mix until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the boiling water to the batter, mixing well. The batter
        will be thin, but that's okay.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated
        oven for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them
        to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Add the cocoa
        powder, powdered sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat
        until smooth and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the cakes are completely cooled, spread a layer of chocolate
        frosting on top of one cake layer. Place the second cake layer on top
        and frost the entire cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decorate the cake with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or additional
        frosting as desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice and enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate cake! Perfect for any
        celebration or a sweet treat.
