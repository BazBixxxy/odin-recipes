    <p>
      Pilau is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originated in South Asia
      and is popular in various cuisines worldwide. The dish involves cooking
      basmati rice with a blend of spices such as cumin, cloves, cardamom, and
      cinnamon, creating a fragrant and savory flavor profile. Often, pilau
      includes sautéed onions, ginger-garlic paste, and a mix of vegetables for
      added texture and taste. The rice is cooked in broth, either chicken or
      vegetable, enhancing its richness. Pilau is known for its distinctive
      yellow color, thanks to the inclusion of turmeric. The finished dish is a
      delicious and well-seasoned rice preparation, commonly served as a side or
      as a main course.
