    <h1>Pork Ribs Recipe</h1>

    <p>
      Pork ribs are a popular and savory dish made from racks of pork baby back
      ribs. The ribs are typically seasoned with a flavorful dry rub, which may
      include ingredients like brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, cumin, and
      garlic powder. They are then slow-cooked in the oven at a low temperature,
      allowing the meat to become tender and flavorful. After baking, the ribs
      are often brushed with barbecue sauce and may be broiled for a caramelized
      finish. The end result is succulent and juicy pork ribs with a delicious
      combination of smoky, sweet, and savory flavors. This dish is a favorite
      at barbecues and gatherings, enjoyed for its finger-licking goodness.

      <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Recipe</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 275°F (135°C).</li>
      <li>
        On the bone side of the ribs, use a knife to lift and loosen the
        membrane, then grip it with a paper towel and pull it off.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, mix together salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, garlic
        powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Rub this mixture all over the
        ribs, ensuring they are evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, combine brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, cumin,
        onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Rub
        the ribs generously with this dry rub, covering both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Individually wrap each rack of ribs tightly in aluminum foil. Place them
        on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 2.5 to 3 hours, or
        until the meat is tender and almost falling off the bone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully unwrap the ribs and brush them with your favorite barbecue
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you prefer a caramelized crust, place the sauced ribs under the
        broiler for a few minutes until the sauce is slightly caramelized. Watch
        closely to avoid burning
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the ribs to rest for a few minutes before slicing between the
        bones. Serve with extra barbecue sauce on the side.
      </li>
    </ol>
